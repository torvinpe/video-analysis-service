# Deployment

## Web server

Install gunicorn (`pip install gunicorn`), and:

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 127.0.0.1:4000 app:app
```
Install nginx (`sudo apt install nginx`)

Example nginx config (`/etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy-flask.conf`):

```
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name server-name-here;

    auth_basic "Password";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

    client_max_body_size 50M;

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:4000/;
        proxy_redirect     off;

        proxy_set_header   Host                 $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP            $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For      $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto    $scheme;
    }
}
```

Password file can be created with `htpasswd` command (`yum install httpd-tools`):

```bash
htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd username
```

## Clean up

A clean up process can be run with the command:

```bash
flask clean-up
```

It will delete old files and analyses based on the `clean_up_files_days` and
`clean_up_analyses_days` config options.  One can for example run this command
in a cron job every night.

## Create services

To create operating system services that will, for example, be automatically
started when the system boots we use systemd which is used on both Ubuntu and
CentOS.

There are two service files in the `system` directory: `celery.service` and
`gunicorn.service`.  First edit them so that the paths are correct.

Next copy the service files to where your system's service files should be. This
is `/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/` on CentOS, and `/etc/systemd/system` on some
Ubuntu systems.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/systemd/system/
sudo cp system/*.service /usr/local/lib/systemd/system/
```

Finally we need to reload systemd and start the `gunicorn.service`. If
everything goes well it should automatically start also celery and redis.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start gunicorn
```

You can check the status of a service by:

```bash
sudo systemctl status gunicorn
```

Or even for all three: `sudo systemctl status redis celery gunicorn`.


Finally, to enable automatic startup when the computer is booted:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable gunicorn
```
